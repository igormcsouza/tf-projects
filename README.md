# Tensorflow Projects

**Tensorflow** is a powerful tool to help building machine learning models and 
evaluate them. As a Data Scientist, is very important to have at hand all the 
code and study I can have on that. So I decided to enroll in a course of
Tensorflow to learn new strategies and estabilish one of the most need skills.

2. 

## Set up

All the modules share the same python enviroment. Follow the commands bellow to 
set up your environment.
